# Shell module contract

The application shell that contains the game. Read `DESIGN.md` section 10 and
`docs/COMPLIANCE.md` first. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` still governs `src/game`, `src/engine`,
`src/art` and `src/renderer` — none of which this wave may modify except where a file is
explicitly assigned below.

```
  src/shell/core/     stores, i18n, regex engine, history, export. No DOM.
      |
      v
  src/shell/ui/       DOM components. Import core; never import game internals.
      |
      v
  src/shell/app.ts    mounts the shell, owns tabs, hosts the game in the Farm tab.
```

Shared rules for every lane:

- **DOM, not canvas**, except display type (draw with `src/engine/font.ts` onto a canvas).
- **No framework, no new dependency.** Plain TypeScript and `document.createElement`.
- Every control is a real focusable element with an accessible name and correct state.
  No `<div onclick>`. Visible focus everywhere, never `outline: none` without a replacement.
- All colour comes from the CSS custom properties in `src/shell/ui/tokens.css`, which are
  generated from `src/engine/palette.ts`. No literal hex in any other stylesheet.
- Nothing persists except through `src/shell/core/store.ts`. No direct `localStorage`.
- Every user-visible string goes through `t()` from `src/shell/core/i18n.ts`. No bare
  English in a component. Facts interpolate as parameters so the funny level cannot touch
  them.
- Every list, table, picker, menu and settings surface gets a search field, and every
  search field gets its own anchored regex builder and a catalogue entry.

## src/shell/core/store.ts — lane: state

```ts
export interface Persisted { settings: Settings; appearance: AppearanceMap; tabs: TabState; history: HistoryEntry[] }
export function load(): Promise<Persisted>
export function save(patch: Partial<Persisted>): Promise<void>
export function subscribe(fn: (p: Persisted) => void): () => void
export function get(): Persisted
export function resetAll(): Promise<void>
```

Versioned, defensive, never throws on malformed stored data — fall back to defaults per
key rather than losing the whole record. Backed by `window.sprout` when present and
`localStorage` otherwise, mirroring `src/renderer/bridge.ts`.

## src/shell/core/i18n.ts + strings.ts — lane: i18n

```ts
export type Lang = 'en' | 'yue' | 'both'
export interface FunnyLevels { en: 1|2|3|4|5; yue: 1|2|3|4|5 }
export function t(key: StringKey, params?: Record<string, string | number>): string
export function setLang(lang: Lang): void
export function setFunny(levels: Partial<FunnyLevels>): void
export function onLangChange(fn: () => void): () => void
export function availableKeys(): StringKey[]
```

`strings.ts` holds, for every key, an English and a Cantonese entry at all five funny
levels. Level 1 is plain and factual; level 5 is theatrical. **Interpolated parameters are
never rewritten at any level** — a test enforces that every level of every key contains the
same parameter placeholders. `both` mode renders `english · cantonese` compactly.

Cover every string in the shell **and** every message `src/game/actions.ts` and
`src/game/shop.ts` return, keyed by a stable id.

## src/shell/core/regex.ts — lane: regex

```ts
export type Dialect = 'ecmascript'
export interface CompileResult { ok: true; re: RegExp } | { ok: false; error: string; index?: number }
export function compile(pattern: string, flags: string): CompileResult
export interface MatchRun { matches: Match[]; truncated: boolean; timedOut: boolean }
export function run(re: RegExp, sample: string, limits?: Limits): MatchRun
export function escapeLiteral(s: string): string
export function plainToPattern(query: string): string
```

State the real dialect (ECMAScript `RegExp`), the real escaping rules and the real bounds.
Bound sample length, match count and elapsed time; abort a run that exceeds the time budget
so an adversarial pattern cannot hang the app. Handle Unicode, multiline, zero-width matches
and no-match cleanly.

## src/shell/core/history.ts + export.ts — lane: history

```ts
export function record(kind: HistoryKind, summary: string, detail?: Record<string, unknown>): void
export function query(filter: { text?: string; pattern?: RegExp; kind?: HistoryKind }): HistoryEntry[]
export function clear(): Promise<void>
export function exportAs(format: 'json' | 'csv' | 'markdown', what: ExportTarget): string
export function download(filename: string, contents: string, mime: string): void
```

Local only. Bounded to a sensible entry count with the oldest dropped. Export covers the
save, the settings, the appearance map and the history.

## src/shell/core/palette-registry.ts — lane: palette

```ts
export interface Command { id: string; titleKey: StringKey; group: string; keywords?: string[]; run(): void }
export interface Target { id: string; titleKey: StringKey; group: string; teleport(): void }
export function registerCommand(c: Command): () => void
export function registerTarget(t: Target): () => void
export function search(query: string, useRegex: boolean): Array<Command | Target>
```

Every tab, settings row, appearance-editable element and documentation section registers a
`Target` whose `teleport()` really focuses it — switching tab, expanding its group,
scrolling it into view and moving focus onto it.

---

## src/shell/ui/tokens.css + base.css — lane: styles

Custom properties for all fourteen palette entries plus spacing, the wood-panel and button
recipes from `DESIGN.md` section 6, focus rings, the notification stack, the scale ladder
(100/125/150/200 %) and a narrow-window path down to 640 px. Reduced-motion block.
Generated tokens must match `src/engine/palette.ts` exactly; a test asserts it.

## src/shell/ui/titlebar.ts — lane: chrome

Frameless custom title bar, `banner` landmark, `-webkit-app-region` drag, real
minimise/maximise/close buttons wired to new `window:*` IPC. Double-click maximises.

## src/shell/ui/tabs.ts + tabmodel.ts + tabsearch.ts — lane: tabs

Persistent browser-style tabs: overflow with a scroll/menu affordance, reorder by drag and
by `Ctrl+Shift+←/→`, pin, named groups with collapse, and the full `tablist`/`tab`/
`tabpanel` roles with `aria-selected` and roving tabindex. `tabsearch.ts` implements the
four searches — current strip, each group, group names, and all app-owned tabs — plus
**Close tabs containing text** and **Close tabs not containing text** sharing one predicate,
with preview, count, an invalid/empty-query guard, pinned excluded by default, and unsaved
work protected.

## src/shell/ui/searchfield.ts + regexbuilder.ts — lane: regex

One reusable search field that owns its own builder in an anchored popover. Plain text is
the default; regex is an explicit opt-in toggle. Guided literals, character classes,
anchors, groups, alternation, quantifiers; raw pattern editing; flags; bounded sample text;
live matches with capture groups; syntax feedback; copy and export. **No builder state is
shared between fields.** Patterns are not persisted.

## src/shell/ui/catalogue.ts — lane: regex

The hand-written catalogue of every search surface in the app: id, where it lives, what it
searches. `tests/search-catalogue.test.ts` asserts every registered field appears in it and
every catalogue entry resolves to a real field — a guard that fails when a field is added
without an entry.

## src/shell/ui/settings.ts — lane: settings

The Settings tab: grouped, tabbed sections, its own search field, every control real and
persisted. Sections: Language (mode + both funny levels, with the facts-unchanged
disclosure), Appearance, Motion & accessibility, Display scale, Audio, Game, Data
(export/import/reset), About. Every row registers a palette `Target`.

## src/shell/ui/appearance.ts + colorpicker.ts — lane: appearance

```ts
export function appearanceFor(elementId: string): AppearanceValue
export function attachEditor(el: HTMLElement, elementId: string, opts: EditorOpts): void
export function resetAppearance(elementId: string): void
```

Every rendered element exposes an anchored `Edit appearance…` affordance — context menu and
a keyboard route — editing a persisted, resettable value. Pickers are searchable and
keyboard operable. Colours use a continuous 2-D picker plus hue slider, with bidirectional
translation between hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()` and the named palette entries: editing any
representation updates the others live.

## src/shell/ui/notify.ts — lane: notify

Non-blocking stack, `role="status"` for informational and `role="alert"` for failures,
never steals focus, dismissible, bounded, pauses its timeout on hover and focus.
`confirm()` here is the *only* blocking dialog helper: focus-trapped, Esc-cancellable,
returning a promise. Use it for destructive actions only.

## src/shell/ui/almanac.ts + changelog.ts — lane: docs

Almanac is offline documentation: how to play, every crop with its real numbers **read from
`src/game/crops.ts`** rather than retyped, the full control table, and an accessibility
statement. Changelog renders `CHANGELOG.md`, imported at build time as a string. Both are
searchable with their own builders, and every section registers a palette `Target`.

## src/shell/ui/surprise.ts — lane: docs

The dim-sum surprise: a small, opt-in, playful flourish. **It draws its own pixel art and
ships no photographs and makes no network request** — the shared contract's public-catalog
rule is about not inventing or copying photos, and the offline rule here forbids fetching
them, so the honest implementation is drawn, not sourced. Record this in `COMPLIANCE.md`.

## src/shell/app.ts + src/shell/ui/farmtab.ts + src/renderer3d — lane: integration

`app.ts` mounts the title bar, tab strip and panels, opens the default tabs, and keeps the Farm
tab pinned. `farmtab.ts` now hosts `renderer3d/farm-surface.ts`, which owns the responsive WebGL
canvas and drives `ThreeRuntime` with an explicit request-animation-frame clock. The runtime
provides the visible low-poly player, camera-relative movement, collision, jumping, streamed
fallback cells, lighting, orbit, zoom, recenter, shoulder switching, and one logical input path
for keyboard/mouse and gamepad. The host pauses and clears input when the tab is hidden, resumes
and resizes it when shown, reports boot and WebGL failures as readable shell text, and disposes
all listeners, streamed cells, renderer resources, and player resources with the panel.

The deterministic farming-state adapter and its save contract remain separate work. Until that
adapter is connected, `FarmTab.state()` returns `null`, `apply()` is inert, and `saveNow()` has
no runtime state to write; the rest of the shell stays available without crossing the hardened
Electron boundary.
