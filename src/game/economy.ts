/**
 * The market: what a thing is worth today, and why.
 *
 * Implements `docs/ECONOMY.md` sections 1-3 exactly:
 *
 *   price        = round(base x qualityMultiplier x supplyFactor x seasonalDemand x reputationBonus)
 *   supplyFactor = clamp(1 / supplyIndex ^ elasticity, 0.4, 1.8)
 *
 * The two clamps are hard. A price can never reach zero and never runs away, whatever the
 * player does to the supply index.
 *
 * `elasticity` is per good. Staples barely move; luxuries swing hard. Because the
 * high-margin goods are also the volatile ones, "make the most valuable thing and dump it"
 * is never simply correct — that tension is the whole system.
 *
 * ## Who owns which number
 *
 * `products.ts` owns **what a manufactured or animal good is worth**: it derives a base
 * price and a full `GoodEconomics` for each of its two hundred products from the real
 * recipes in `factories.ts`. Where it answers, this file uses its numbers verbatim. There
 * is one product price table in this repository, not two that drift apart.
 *
 * `crops.ts` and `trees.ts` own what a raw plant is worth. They carry a `basePrice` but no
 * market behaviour, so the elasticity, recovery and seasonal curve for produce are set
 * here, from the price and the growing season.
 *
 * This file owns **what any of it fetches today**: supply, seasonal demand, weekly events,
 * reputation, price history, and the arithmetic that ties them together.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock, touches the DOM or calls `Math.random`. Every roll goes
 * through `rngFor(seed, salt)`, so a save always replays identically. Every function that
 * takes a `GameState` returns a new one and never mutates its input.
 *
 * Intended overnight order for the caller:
 *   dailyRecovery(state) -> refreshEvent(state) -> recordPrices(state)
