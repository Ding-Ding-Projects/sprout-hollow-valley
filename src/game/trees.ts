/**
 * Trees and bushes — the 14 perennials of `docs/CATALOG.md` section 2.
 *
 * A tree is bought as a sapling, planted once, and then **never replanted**. It takes
 * most of a season to mature, after which it bears fruit on a repeating cycle for the
 * rest of the save. The trade is the tile: that ground is gone for good, and cleared
 * ground is the thing everything else on the farm is competing for
 * (`docs/PROGRESSION.md` section 3). A crop tile can be four different things in a
 * year; a tree tile is one thing forever.
 *
 * The three rules that make a tree a tree rather than a slow crop:
 *
 * 1. **It does not need watering.** `stageDays` here counts calendar days, not watered
 *    days, and a tree never withers. Nothing about a tree is a daily chore.
 * 2. **Saplings sleep through winter.** Growth stops in winter and resumes in spring,
 *    so a sapling planted in autumn costs the player a whole dead season. Plant in
 *    spring.
 * 3. **It only fruits in its seasons.** Out of season a mature tree simply stands
 *    there — its cycle does not tick. A two-season tree therefore earns roughly twice
 *    what a one-season tree of the same price earns, which is why it costs more and
 *    sits further up the level ladder.
 *
 * `TreeDef` extends `CropDef` so a tree can be handed straight to anything that
 * already understands a crop — the plant renderer, the almanac table, the item
 * naming — with `seedCost` reading as the sapling price and `regrowDays` as the
 * fruiting cycle. It is never a member of `CROPS`, so `cropById` will not find one:
 * a caller holding a `Plant` looks it up with `cropById` first and `treeById` second.
 *
 * Balance intent: a mature tree grosses roughly `sapling / 0.8` per year, so it pays
 * for itself in its first full fruiting season and is free money after that. That
 * gross is a little under what an attentively farmed crop tile makes across four
 * seasons — a tree trades ceiling for zero labour and zero recurring seed cost.
 * No two entries share a fruit colour, here or with `CROPS`.
